Our project is an in-class interactive quiz-taking application for students and teacher. The application requires two types of users: a teacher and students. 

On the teacher side, the teacher logs in by simply going to {host:port}/static/teacher.html. The teacher can create a question to be asked by clicking on the "Add a Question" button and filling out the fields which appear. After clicking submit, the question will be saved in the menu under the selected topic. When a teacher whishes to ask the set of questions for the given topic, he clicks on the topic and cicks the administer button to administer the quiz. When all the students have made submitted their responses, the teacher may view the results by clicking the "View Results" button.

On the student side, a student logs in by simply submiting an id (such as their andrew id) on the home screen.
